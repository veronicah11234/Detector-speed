# Demerit Points Calculator

This is a simple program that calculates demerit points based on the speed of a car.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the car speed in the input field.
3. Click the "Calculate Demerit Points" button.

## Rules

- If the speed is less than 70, it will display "Ok."
- For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it will give the driver one demerit point.
- The total demerit points will be displayed.
- If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program will print "License suspended."

## Example

- Entering a speed of 80 will display "Points: 2" (2 points for exceeding the speed limit by 10 km/s).
